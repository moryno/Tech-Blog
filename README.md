## Description

---

On the third week in Web Development course we cover intoduction to Javascript. Javascript allows interaction with the page. While HTML is for structuring webpages and CSS is for styling the page.  
With the help of the three, _**HTML, CSS**_ and _**Javascript**_ , I made a quiz board for after-school computer class to take, to test their understanding of _**Javascript**_. It is a multiple choice questions website where they get to pick the answer they think is correct. And after submitting their selected answers they get their scores back.  
With the help of _**Javascript**_ I was able to create functions that can be performed by some of the features of the website. _For example_, when an input box is checked it triggers a function that check the selected answer then compaires the selected answer with the correct answer then stores the points in an array that will be computed when submit button is clicked.  
With the _**Javascript**_ I was able to create a quiz carousel, then the student is done select their answer they can click on the _nextQuiz_ button which allows the next slider with the next question to show up. They have the ability to go back to the previous question if they want to change their answers.
Then on the last question the _submit_ button allows them to post their answer and this triggers a fuction that goes through the points array then sum all the points the students got then displays the score to them.

## Features

---

The computer club students visiting this page would be able to see:

2. Multi-choice questions

3. An input they can select thei answer

4. Sliders containing different questions

5. A submit button to submit their answer when they are done

6. Their score at the header section

### Technology Used

---

- Used Visual Studio Code editor to write the _**HTML**_, _**CSS**_ and _**Javascript**_ used to create the quiz board website.

- **HTML** - HTML was used to create the structure and foundation of the landing page.

- **CSS** - used css to style the website to look appealing to the user.

- **Javascript** - Used Javascript to create functions, conditions and loops to manipulate items on the webpage. Especially added event listeners that can listen and trigger a function when features like input checkbox and buttons are clicked on.

- Employed the help of [www.w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_element_classlist.asp) to be able to add and remove class attributes. With the help of [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9709209/html-select-only-one-checkbox-in-a-group) I was able to add the function to allow only one answer to be selcted at a time.
